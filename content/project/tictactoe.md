The goal of this project is to make it easier for teachers to plan lessons where multiple teachers are involved. The
project exports data which can be used in the [Untis](https://www.untis.at) software, which is widely used in schools in
Austria and Germany.

The software is used to plan lessons, manage timetables, and organize teacher schedules.
