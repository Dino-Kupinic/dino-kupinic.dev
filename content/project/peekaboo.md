## Description

Peekaboo is a simple nginx log viewer that allows you to view your nginx logs in a user-friendly way.
It is built with React and Bun, and is designed to be fast and lightweight.

### Why?

I wanted to create a simple tool that would allow me to view my nginx logs in real-time,
without having to use the command line.
I also wanted to learn more about Bun, and this project was a great way to do that.

### Features

- Real-time log viewing with WebSocket support
- Runs on Bun for blazingly fast performance
- Modern UI built with ShadCN

### Status

Heavily work in progress (as of 19.06.2025)
