## Description

E-Reader is a book/DVD borrowing management system for libraries.
It allows librarians to manage their inventory, check in/check out books and DVDs, and keep track of their borrowers.

The software is built with JavaFX for the frontend.
JavaFX is a software platform for creating and delivering desktop applications,
as well as rich internet applications (RIAs) that can run across a wide variety of devices.

The backend is built with Spring, a popular Java framework for building enterprise applications.
Though in this case, it's used for CRUD operations on the MySQL database instead of a fully fledged REST-API.
