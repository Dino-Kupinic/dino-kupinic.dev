## Description

The goal of this project is to make it easier for teachers to plan lessons where multiple teachers are involved. The
project exports data which can be used in the [Untis](https://www.untis.at) software, which is widely used in schools in
Austria and Germany.

The software is used to plan lessons, manage timetables, and organize teacher schedules.
