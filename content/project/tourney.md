## Description

Tourney is the tournament app to support the yearly football-, volleyball- and basketball tournament at my previous school.

### Why?

Previously, the tournament was managed using an Excel sheet,
which was not ideal for managing multiple tournaments and live match results.

I saw an opportunity to create a web application that would streamline the process and make it more efficient.
Tourney provides a user-friendly interface for both organizers and students to manage tournaments effectively.

### Features

- Create and manage multiple tournaments across sports
- Live match results, standings and editable history
- Automatic bracket generation with live visualization
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Media and news section with Markdown editor
- Dedicated dashboard for organizers

### Outcome

- Replaced a clunky Excel-based process with a modern web app used for registration, scheduling, and live score tracking.
- Saved hours of manual coordination for organizers by centralizing all tournament operations in one dashboard.
- The app is now the default system for tournament management at our school.

### Future

The repo has a streamlined structure and is ready for contributions (issue-based project management).
One of my friends will be working on the app to add more features and improve the user experience.
