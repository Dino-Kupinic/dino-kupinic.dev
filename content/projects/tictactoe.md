## Description

TicTacToe is a simple game that can be played by two players.
The game is played on a 3x3 grid.

The first player is represented by an X and the second player by an O. The players take turns to place their symbol on the grid.

The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.

If all the cells are filled and no player has won, the game is a draw.
