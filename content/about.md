## Hey there! 👋

My name is Dino Kupinic (as you might have guessed) and I'm a software engineer from Austria.
I'm currently pursuing a high school diploma in information technology and network technology.

I enjoy building full-stack applications and working with modern technologies. I'm always looking for new things to
learn and improve on.
I also enjoy playing video games, listening to music, watching movies/shows or reading books.

Right now I'm working on a few projects, which you can find on my [GitHub](https://github.com/Dino-Kupinic).
Machine Learning and LLMs (Large Language Models) are my current focus, but I'm also working on a few web applications.
I'm also writing blog posts about things I learn and find interesting.

## This Website

I built this website because I wanted to have a place where I can showcase my projects, write blog posts and share a
little bit about myself on the internet.
Building this website was a fun experience, and I learned a lot about web development in the process.
Though it's not perfect, I'm happy with the result, and I'm looking forward to improving it in the future.

## Inspiration

I got inspired by the design of [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org). I wanted to build
something similar, but with my own twist.
Thanks to [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for the awesome component library, which I used as a base for my website.

## Tech Stack

While I'm not going to list every single package I used, I want to highlight a few that I found particularly useful.
Fun fact: I actually removed a lot of packages that I initially used because I decided against using a server and
database.
This website is now completely static!
