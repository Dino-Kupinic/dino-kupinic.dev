## Trying Bun

As a software engineer, I'm constantly on the lookout for tools that make development faster, cleaner, and more
enjoyable.
Two weeks ago, I stumbled across [Bun](https://bun.sh) and decided to give it a try.
I had heard the buzz, but I was skeptical.

I mean, how many times have we seen new JavaScript stuff pop up, only to fade into obscurity?
But after a few hours of tinkering, I was genuinely impressed.

## Why I love it so much

Bun isn't just a runtime, but for some reason it has everything you need to build cool stuff.

- **Blazingly fast**: Startup and execution times blew me away.
  It made my scripts feel snappy in a way Node just doesn’t.
- **Incredible tooling**: You get built-in bundling, testing, packaging (and a runner called `bunx`),
  websockets, templating (with React too), and native bindings for databases!
- **Drop-in replacement**: It just works. (Almost, not everything is supported yet, but the most important stuff is.)
  You can likely run your existing Node.js code with Bun without any changes.

## Should You Switch?

If you're deep in a Node or Deno setup, I'm not saying you need to rewrite everything overnight.
But I _am_ saying you should give Bun a shot on your next small project or script.
