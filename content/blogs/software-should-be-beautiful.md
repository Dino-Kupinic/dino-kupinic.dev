Design is everything.

It's the first thing we notice when we look at something, and it's the first thing that makes us feel a certain way.
It's the first thing that makes us want to use something, and it's the first thing that makes us want to keep using it.

## Beauty

When we think of beauty, we often picture visual aesthetics, paintings, sculptures, or stunning architecture.
But software, in its essence, can be just as beautiful.

Good software isn't just about a sleek user interface!
It's about the harmony between functionality, efficiency, and user experience.

## Why you should give a f*ck

### Cognitive Load

Beautiful software reduces cognitive load.
When code is well-organized and interfaces are intuitive,
users and developers spend less mental energy understanding and using the system.
This isn't just about aesthetics – it's about mental efficiency.

Big offenders in this area are:

- [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/)
- [Shopware](https://www.shopware.com/)
- [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)
- [SAP](https://www.sap.com/)

If you've ever used or seen any of these, you know what I'm talking about.

Are they functional? `Yes`.
Are they beautiful and easy to use? `No`.

Funnily enough, there is a whole market of companies that wrap AWS services in a more user-friendly interface.

### Trust and Credibility

Users inherently trust well-designed software more.
When you encounter a poorly designed application, don't you question its reliability?
Beautiful software builds confidence and credibility.

Am I the only one who thought amazon was a scam when I first saw it?

## So how do we make it pretty?

### Clean Architecture

Beautiful software starts with clean architecture.
Like a well-designed building, software needs strong foundations and logical organization.
This means:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Intuitive module organization
- Consistent patterns and practices

### Thoughtful User Experience

The user interface should feel natural and easy to use:
- Consistent visual language and layout
- Meaningful animations and transitions (not just for show)
- Responsive and adaptive design (mobile-friendly)
- Accessibility for all users

## My Approach

When designing software, I follow these principles.
Keep in mind that these are just guidelines, not strict rules.

---

**Start with Purpose**
  - Understand your users' needs
  - Define clear objectives
  - Plan before implementing (design first)

Some form of whiteboarding or sketching is always a good idea.
It's much easier to iterate than in code. I usually use [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) for this.

---

**Embrace Simplicity**
  - Remove unnecessary complexity
  - Focus on core functionality
  - Make decisions obvious

You don't need to reinvent the wheel.
Use established patterns and practices.
Users should be able to use your software without reading a manual
(unless your software isn't aerospace related or similar).

---

**Pay Attention to Details**
  - Consistent spacing and formatting
  - Thoughtful error messages

`"Oops! An error occurred, please try again!"` is not helpful.

---

**Test and Iterate**
  - Gather user feedback
  - Measure performance
  - Continuously improve

## Conclusion

Beautiful software isn't a luxury – it's a necessity in today's competitive landscape.
It's the difference between software that users tolerate and software that users love.

Developers and designers have a responsibility to create software that not only works but brings joy.
