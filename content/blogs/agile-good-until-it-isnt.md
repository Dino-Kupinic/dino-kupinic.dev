Ah, Agile. The methodology that promised to revolutionize software development.
The answer to waterfall's rigidity.
The solution to all our project management woes. Except when it isn't – which seems most of the time.

## Promise vs. Reality

Agile and SCRUM have become synonymous with software development, but the reality often falls short of the promise.
It's not that Agile is inherently bad – it's just that most organizations don't know how to do it right.

Below is a comparison of what Agile promises and what it often delivers
_(this is a generalization and not representative of all Agile projects)_:


| Promise                           | Reality                                                                                       |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Flexible and adaptive development | Daily standups that feel like interrogations                                                  |
| Better communication              | Sprint planning that's basically waterfall with extra steps                                   |
| Faster delivery                   | Story points that somehow became hours again                                                  |
| Productive environment            | "Meetings" that eat up half your work week                                                    |
| Satisfied customers               | Product owners who treat the backlog like a wish list                                         |
| Happy developers                  | 80% of developers are unhappy with their job, [source](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/) |

## Where It All Went Wrong

In theory, Agile is about flexibility, adaptability, and collaboration.
In practice, it's often about bureaucracy, process, and meetings.

### Only "Prescriptive" Agile

- The Scrum Master ✅
- The Jira board (or similar) ✅
- The daily standups ✅
- The two-week/three-week sprints ✅
- The actual agility ❌

### Agile Circus

```
PM: "We're Agile!"
Also PM: "I need a detailed estimate for the next 6 months"
```

This cognitive dissonance is everywhere. Teams claim to be Agile while:

- Requiring detailed specifications upfront
- Refusing to adapt to change
- Measuring success by story point velocity
- Treating the sprint backlog as carved in stone

### Meetings, Meetings, Meetings

A typical "Agile" week:

| Day       | Activity                  | Duration      |
|-----------|---------------------------|---------------|
| Monday    | Sprint Planning           | 2 hours       |
| Tuesday   | Backlog Refinement        | 1 hour        |
| Wednesday | Technical Debt Discussion | 1 hour        |
| Thursday  | Sprint Review             | 1 hour        |
| Friday    | Retrospective             | 1.5 hours     |
| Every Day | Daily Standup             | 15–30 minutes |

That's roughly 7–9 hours per week just in ceremonies. When exactly are we supposed to code?

## Certification Industrial Complex

Certified Scrum Master, Professional Scrum Master (PSM1, PSM2, PSM3), SAFe Scrum Master...

Yet somehow, despite all these certified experts, projects still go over budget, miss deadlines, deliver wrong features
and accumulate technical debt?!

## Cut out all the bullsh*t

- Keep standups under 10 minutes and only include people who need to be there
- Make retrospectives actionable
- Plan only what you can reasonably forecast and adjust as needed
- Skip ceremonies that don't add value

## Conclusion

Agile isn't that bad – it's just been corrupted by process-obsessed organizations and certification mills. The original
Agile
Manifesto was just 68 words, yet somehow we've turned it into a bureaucratic nightmare.
